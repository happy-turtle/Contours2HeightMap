# Contours2HeightMap
A Compute shader that generates a height map from 2D vector contours. In combination with a tesselation shader this can be used to generate three-dimensional geometry out of two-dimensional polygons. 
We extracted contours out of a video with OpenCV and used these contours as input for the compute shader. Using the height map with a tesselation shader you get a three-dimensional geometry out of a simple video.
Changing the mapping function `1.0 - rcp(1.0 + smallestDistance * curviness)` at the end of the shader will result in different shaping of the geometry.

This shader was written as part of the research publication [Real-Time Relighting of Video Streams for Augmented Virtuality Scenes](https://vsvr.medien.hs-duesseldorf.de/publications/gi-vrar2021-relighting/) and a corresponding [master's thesis](https://vsvr.medien.hs-duesseldorf.de/education/diplom/2021/davin-master2021.html) at the Virtual Sets and Virtual Environments Laboratory of the University of Applied Sciences DÃ¼sseldorf.
